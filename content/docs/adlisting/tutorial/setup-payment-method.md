#### How to do payment setting

- Go to your **Admin panel** -\> **Settings** -\> **Payment**, If you want to live mode then turn on it. After that generate your ID and client secret. You can use:

  1.  Paypal
  2.  Stripe
  3.  Razorpay
  4.  SSL Commerz
  5.  Paystack

- Fill out a form with the correct credentials and save the form individually. Make the status on to allow users to use your desired payment system. The payment system that has status off will be hidden on the website.

- Click on the Update button payment will be done.
