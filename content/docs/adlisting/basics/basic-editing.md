# How to edit code

Last updated: Nov 25th, 2021

## Basics

Before we get started, let's take a look at the tools we need for editing.

- Code Editor (I recommend [VS Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) , but you can use any.)
- Browser (I recommend [Google Chrome](http://chrome.google.com) Any browser is ok)

##### Requirements

---

You must have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS & Website. If you don't have any knowledge, I would recommend not to overrite project files.

##### Files and Folder

Once You Install The Product on Your Server, You Will have Two Folder and Few Files. On Folder "backend" or "frontend", We keep all kind of asset like CSS, JS, Images. So if You Want To Edit Or Change Any Asset, Have a Look on This Folder.

On Folder "script", We keep The Core of Laravel.

We Maintain Laravel Structure(MVC) on This Project.

`routes/web.php & Modules/*/Routes/web.php` All Routes (URL) in This Folder. You can find the ControllerName@MethodName Here.

`app/models & Modules/*/Entities` All Models are in This Folder.
