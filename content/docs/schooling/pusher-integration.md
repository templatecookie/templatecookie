# Live Chat Integration

PusherJS is a useful tool for developers who want to add real-time features to their web applications in a simple and efficient way. It abstracts away much of the complexity involved in handling websockets and other low-level protocols, and provides a cloud-based service for managing real-time communication between a server and a client.
