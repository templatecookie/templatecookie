### What is SMTP?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol)

> The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is an internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages.

Across the entire application, We have created many email templates like Account Verification email, Job Post Approval, Candidate Applied, and many more!

To send all the necessary emails, we need an Email Delivery service. Jobpilot uses SMTP for sending emails. Some of the popular SMTP Email Delivery Companies

1. Amazon SES
2. Mailtrap
3. Mailgun
4. Postmark
5. Sendmail
6. Sengrid

**In short, it is used to send emails to your site users..!! You can use any email delivery platform as long as it supports SMTP.**
